STEP 1 — Go to your Project Folder
cd /mnt/c/Users/asus/Downloads/'Capstone Project 4'/netshare


Check your files:

ls


You should see:

server  client  server.cpp  client.cpp  Makefile  shared_root/

STEP 2 — Start the Server
./server 0.0.0.0 9000 ./shared_root


Output:

[*] Serving "/mnt/c/Users/asus/Downloads/Capstone Project 4/netshare/shared_root" on 0.0.0.0:9000


Keep this terminal running.

STEP 3 — Open a Second Terminal (for Client)

Press Ctrl + Shift + ` in VS Code or open a new Ubuntu tab.

Go to the same directory:

cd /mnt/c/Users/asus/Downloads/'Capstone Project 4'/netshare


Connect the client:

./client localhost 9000


You’ll see:

Connected. Type 'help' for commands.
>

STEP 4 — Upload and Verify Files in Terminal

At the > client prompt, type:

put client.cpp uploads/client.cpp
put server.cpp uploads/server.cpp
ls uploads


Expected output:

File uploaded successfully: uploads/client.cpp
File uploaded successfully: uploads/server.cpp
uploads/
 ├── client.cpp
 └── server.cpp


Then you can safely quit:

quit


Client exits cleanly, and the server terminal shows logs:

[UPLOAD] uploads/client.cpp (5148 bytes)
[UPLOAD] uploads/server.cpp (6357 bytes)
[-] client disconnected

STEP 5 — Verify Uploads (Server Side)

In the server terminal or a new one, check:

cd /mnt/c/Users/asus/Downloads/'Capstone Project 4'/netshare/shared_root/uploads
ls


You’ll see:

client.cpp  server.cpp

STEP 6 — View Files in Browser (Web Access)

Now start a simple Python web server inside the same shared folder:

cd /mnt/c/Users/asus/Downloads/'Capstone Project 4'/netshare/shared_root
python3 -m http.server 8080


Output:

Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8080 ...


Now open your browser and visit:

http://localhost:8080/


You’ll see your shared files (including uploads/) in a web-based file explorer view.

Click uploads/ → you’ll see the uploaded files (client.cpp, server.cpp).

STEP 7 — Optional: Serve only uploads

If you want the browser to show only uploaded files:

cd /mnt/c/Users/asus/Downloads/'Capstone Project 4'/netshare/shared_root/uploads
python3 -m http.server 8081


Then visit:

http://localhost:8081/
